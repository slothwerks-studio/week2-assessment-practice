		<!-- Instructions:

			11. Create an HTML document with a button that "flips a coin" and displays the result of the flip to the user. Add an input box where a user can enter a guess of "heads" or "tails" and display whether or not the user guessed correctly. The form should be centered horizontally on the page, have some vertical padding or margin from the top and have a different background than the rest of the page.

		<form id="flip-form">
			<input type="text" id="input-box" />
			<input type="button" value="Flip" id="flip-button" />
			<div id="console-box">Guess "heads" or "tails" for the flip of a coin.  Type your guess into the text box and click the button to flip.  Were you right or wrong?  We shall see!</div>
